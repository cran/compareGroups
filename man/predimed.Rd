\details{
Participants of PREDIMED study were recruited in 2003 and were revisited anually until 2010. In each visit, a large variety of different information was collected: antropometric (body mass index, age, ...), blood samples (Total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, ...), dietary pattern consumtion using validated questionaries, treatments, etc. Also, cardiovascular events were recorded during the follow-up period.
At recruitment period, each participant was assigned to each of the three diet type group. Periodically (every 6-months approximately),  participants were advised to follow the diet corresponding to their group.
To build this example data set approx 85\% of original participants were randomly selected. For more information about this data set, see the vignette.
