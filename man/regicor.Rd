\details{
The variables collected in the REGICOR study were mainly cardiovascular risk factors (hundreds of variables were collected in the different questionnaires and blood measurements), but the variables present in this data set are just a few of them. Also, for reasons of confidentiality, the individuals in this data set are a 30\% approx. random subsample of the original one. \cr \cr
Each variable of this data.frame contains label describing them in the attribute "label". \cr \cr
For more information, see the vignette.

\note{
Variables \code{death}, \code{todeath}, \code{cv}, \code{tocv} are not real but they have been simulated at random to complete the data example with some time-to-event variables.
